Simple bot to create and update supermanager teams

Not well written bot to create and update teams of http://supermanager.acb.com/

Intended only to create teams at begining, it has evolved to semi-automatic updating with a basic prediction of players efficiency.

Uploaded only to make sure it is not lost.

For my me of the future:
  - Copy & paste teams, market and players thare are buyable from a new team. -> Make it automatic please!
  - Be carefull with scrapping, some plyers has names that not match
  - Soooo slow, improve order to not try to many times to buy/remove a player
